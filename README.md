# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Adversarial Attacks against Botnet Detectors: Implementation and Review

This repository contains the implementation and review of a research paper by Giovanni Apruzzese, Michele Colajanni, and Mirco Marchetti titled "Evaluating the effectiveness of Adversarial Attacks against Botnet Detectors." The paper explores the effectiveness of adversarial attacks against botnet detectors, which are used to identify and block botnets on a network.

The implementation in this repository focuses on the machine learning techniques used in the paper to test the four datasets mentioned in the research. We aim to reproduce the results from the paper using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

In addition to the implementation, this repository also includes a detailed review of the research paper and its results. Our review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the paper from our perspective, including any limitations or areas for improvement. We hope that our review will help others to better understand the paper and its implications for botnet detection in cybersecurity.

We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to help improve the implementation and review. Please feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or comments on the repository.
